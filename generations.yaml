    description: "The BMW X7 is the brand's first full-size, three-row luxury SUV, positioned above the X5 as BMW's flagship SUV model. Built on the CLAR platform, it features imposing dimensions with a length of over 5 meters and a distinctive design characterized by a massive kidney grille, slim headlights, and an upright, boxy profile to maximize interior space. The interior offers premium appointments with three rows of seats as standard (either in seven-seat configuration or six-seat with second-row captain's chairs), advanced technology including BMW's latest iDrive system, and a dual-panel panoramic sunroof. Engine options vary by market, including six and eight-cylinder petrol and diesel options, with the range-topping M60i (formerly M50i) featuring a 4.4L twin-turbocharged V8 producing up to 523 HP. All models come standard with air suspension, all-wheel drive, and an eight-speed automatic transmission. A significant facelift in 2022 updated the exterior styling with split headlights, an illuminated kidney grille, and revised interior featuring a curved display combining digital instruments and infotainment running BMW's latest Operating System 8. The X7 competes with vehicles like the Mercedes-Benz GLS and Range Rover, offering BMW's driving dynamics in a package that prioritizes luxury and space for up to seven passengers."
